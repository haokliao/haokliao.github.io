## Repo for my github site!
Website done with HTML, CSS, (iteration 1 done with Bootstrap)

---

Wanted to have a learning journey into web development, and really work on my knowledge of HTML and CSS by applying some general concepts for a site.
<br>

Started designed/drafted my multiple iterations first on figma, [check it out here](https://www.figma.com/file/vrZlp5s0hVYgYLFVym8ocn/Github-Site?node-id=202%3A2) to see the progress!

Currently working on creating a little JS to show my Spotify most recent favs?

<br>

### To Do:


- [x] Create a small little one liner of what I've been listening to on spotify (a whole JOURNEY through spotify API so far)
- [x] Get API tokens for requesting song 
- [x] Write some JS
- [x] Env file for tokens
- [x] Add lines into HTML

Done at haokai.dev!
