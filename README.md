## Repo for my github site!
Website done with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

---


<br/>


Wanted to have a learning journey into front-end, and really work on my knowledge of HTML and CSS to really refine some of my skills in preparation to learn D3.js (for data vis)

Started drafting and multiple iterations first on figma, [click here]("https://www.figma.com/file/vrZlp5s0hVYgYLFVym8ocn/Github-Site?node-id=104%3A19") to see the progress!
Three/four different iterations (there was one with vectors that honestly, seemed very fun and I might still work on that!)

<br>
<br/>
Spent a lot of time trying to work through pure HTML and CSS, and a friend (thanks carol!!) introduced me to Bootstrap, which I ended up using for the entirety of the site.

<br>
<br/>
Currently still a work in progress?
